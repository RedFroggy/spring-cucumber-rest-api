## Stack
- Spring Boot
- Cucumber
- Cucumber-Spring
- Jayway JsonPath
- Rest template (Spring web framework)

## Description
- Predefined steps
- Handle RESTFUL requests
- Possibility to set request headers or parameters
- Possibility to test response headers
- Possibility to test response status code
- Possibility to test the body response using a json path

## Feature template
- In order to successfully use this library, you need to respect the following template for your `.feature` files
(an example file can be found under src/test/resources/template_feature)
- The template was inspired by the awesome [apickli project](https://github.com/apickli/apickli)

  * GIVEN
    * I set (.*) header to (.*)
    * I set body to (.*)
    * I pipe contents of file (.*) to body
    * I have basic authentication credentials (.*) and (.*)
    * I set bearer token
    * I set query parameters to (data table with headers |parameter|value|)
    * I set headers to (data table with headers |name|value|)
  * WHEN
    * I GET $resource
    * I POST to $resource
    * I PUT $resource
    * I DELETE $resource
    * I PATCH $resource
    * I request OPTIONS for $resource
    * I request HEAD for $resource
  * THEN
    * response code should be (\d+)
    * response code should not be (\d+)
    * response header (.*) should exist
    * response header (.*) should not exist
    * response header (.*) should be (.*)
    * response header (.*) should not be (.*)
    * response body should be valid (xml|json)
    * response body should contain (.*)
    * response body should not contain (.*)
    * response body path (.*) should be (.*)
    * response body path (.*) should not be (.*)
    * response body path (.*) should be of type array
    * response body path (.*) should be of type array with length (\d+)
    * response body should be valid according to schema file (.*)
    * response body should be valid according to swagger definition (.*) in file (.*)
    * I store the value of body path (.*) as access token
    * I store the value of response header (.*) as (.*) in scenario scope
    * I store the value of body path (.*) as (.*) in scenario scope
    * value of scenario variable (.*) should be (.*)
    * I store the value of response header (.*) as (.*) in global scope
    * I store the value of body path (.*) as (.*) in global scope


## Examples
Two example feature files are available under src/test/resources/features folder

## How to use it in my existing project ?

- Add CucumberTest file

    * Set the glue property to  "fr.redfroggy.test.bdd.glue" (+ your glue if you have one)
    * Set the features folder property
    * Set plugin property if you want to generate reports

```
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        plugin = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber"},
        features = "src/test/resources/features",
        glue = {"fr.redfroggy.test.bdd.glue"})
public class CucumberTest {

}
````

    
- Add a "fr.redfroggy.test.bdd" package under src/test/java
- Add a Spring Boot Application.java file under fr.redfroggy.test.bdd
- Replace "your.package" with your package (under which spring will be able to find your @Component,@Service,
@RestController, etc...)
- Don't forget to add your .feature files under "src/test/resources/features" for example
````bash
package fr.redfroggy.test.bdd;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"your.package"})
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(fr.sisnet.project.Application.class, args);
    }

}

````


#To run Java unit tests
````bash
$ mvn test
````

It will run two features and test two kind of apis:
- An external one: Swagger petstore api
- An internal one: A spring rest api declared in the project using @RestController
